# Deep-Dive

I write about the findings and internal implementation of various components. I have taken most of the things from Developer documentation and various blog posts and articles. These are just the things that i explain it to myself that help me understand the components better.

So there is a high chance that you have read the description or code somewhere else also. Its not about research or 100% originality here. They are just my understandings taken out after reading from various sources.

###For now you can write any comments in the issues section.
